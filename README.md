## Overview

This project solves the classic **Wolf‚ÄìGoat‚ÄìCabbage (WGC)** river-crossing puzzle using **search algorithms**:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** ‚Äì finds the **shortest** (fewest crossings) solution  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** ‚Äì explores deeply; may detour before finding a solution  
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** ‚Äì finds the **least-cost** solution (equal to BFS when all moves cost 1)

It also includes interactive tracing to explain how we reach the **optimal 7-move solution** (‚ÄúStep 7‚Äù) and how each algorithm differs.

You can open and run the notebook directly:  
```bash
jupyter notebook "CAP_5636_HW3.ipynb"
```

## Problem Structure

Players: Farmer (F), Wolf (W), Goat (G), Cabbage (C)

Banks: Left (L) and Right (R)

Boat: carries Farmer + (at most one) of {W,G,C}

Start: all on Left bank ‚Üí (L,L,L,L) (order F,W,G,C)

Goal: all on Right bank ‚Üí (R,R,R,R)

## Safety Constraints

A state is unsafe (invalid) if the Farmer is absent from a bank where:

W and G are together (wolf eats goat), or

G and C are together (goat eats cabbage).

We must never generate or expand unsafe states.

## State Representation

A state is a 4-tuple of positions (F, W, G, C) where each is 'L' or 'R'.

Examples:

Start: ('L','L','L','L')

Goal: ('R','R','R','R')


### Validity Check (Pseudocode)
'''bash
def safe(state):
    F, W, G, C = state
    # If farmer not with Wolf & Goat together ‚Üí unsafe
    if F != W == G: return False
    # If farmer not with Goat & Cabbage together ‚Üí unsafe
    if F != G == C: return False
    return True
'''
### Moves (Transitions)
From any state:

The Farmer can cross alone, or with exactly one of {W,G,C} that is on the same bank as the Farmer.

After crossing, we must check safe(new_state).
'''bash
ENTITIES = ['F','W','G','C']

def opposite(side): return 'R' if side == 'L' else 'L'

def successors(state):
    F, W, G, C = state
    side = F
    cand = []
    # Farmer alone
    s = list(state); s[0] = opposite(F)
    cand.append(tuple(s))
    # Farmer with one passenger (on same bank)
    for i, label in enumerate(['W','G','C'], start=1):
        if state[i] == side:
            t = list(state)
            t[0] = opposite(F)
            t[i] = opposite(state[i])
            cand.append(tuple(t))
    # Filter unsafe states
    return [x for x in cand if safe(x)]

# üß© Algorithms Implemented

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Uses a queue (FIFO)

Guarantees the fewest crossings solution

With unit costs, BFS result ‚â° UCS result

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Uses a stack (LIFO) / recursion

Memory-light, but may wander into dead ends before backtracking

Solution length can exceed the optimum

###  Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

Uses a priority queue keyed by cumulative path cost

With unit edge costs, returns the same 7-move solution as BFS

Supports custom costs (e.g., penalize taking the goat back) for ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù analyses

---
## Optimal Plan (7 Moves)

The known optimal crossing sequence in 7 moves (Farmer travels each time):

F + G ‚Üí R (W,C on L)

F ‚Üê (G on R)

F + W ‚Üí R (C on L)

F + G ‚Üê (W on R)

F + C ‚Üí R (G on L)

F ‚Üê (W,C on R)

F + G ‚Üí R (Goal)

BFS/UCS should discover a length-7 path; DFS may find longer depending on child ordering.

---
## Step-By-Step Traces (including Step 7)

Below are canonical traces with unit costs and a fixed child ordering:
[Farmer alone, Farmer+W, Farmer+G, Farmer+C].

|     6 |            11 | (R,R,L,R)     | F+C‚ÜíR         |                                |
| **7** |        **12** | **(L,R,L,R)** | **F‚Üê**        | queue still has goal successor |
|     8 |            12 | (R,R,R,R)     | goal dequeued | **Goal reached (7 moves)**     |


## üßæ Final Results Summary

| Algorithm | Solution Found | Moves (Path Length) | Optimal Solution | Search Cost | Characteristics |
|:-----------|:---------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|:------------:|:----------------|
| **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** | ‚úÖ Yes | **7** | ‚úÖ Yes | Moderate | Expands all shallow states first; guarantees the shortest (7-move) crossing plan. |
| **Depth-First Search (DFS)** | ‚úÖ Yes | 8‚Äì12 (varies) | ‚ùå No | Low | Finds a valid plan quickly but may detour; depends on node ordering and depth bound. |
| **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** | ‚úÖ Yes | **7** | ‚úÖ Yes | Moderate | Same as BFS under unit costs; supports weighted edges for cost-optimized variants. |

**Interpretation:**  
BFS and UCS both discover the **7-move optimal solution**, which transfers all entities safely across the river without rule violations.  
DFS also succeeds but may explore redundant paths or exceed the optimal move count depending on traversal order.

Across all algorithms, the winning probability aligns with the theoretical 2/3 success rate for switching versus 1/3 for staying.
