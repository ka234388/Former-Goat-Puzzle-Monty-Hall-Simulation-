## ðŸš€ Overview  

This notebook implements a **simulation of the Monty Hall (Former Goat) Puzzle**, a famous **probability paradox**.  
The goal is to empirically demonstrate why **switching doors** after the host reveals a goat yields a higher chance of winning the car.

You can open and run the notebook directly:  
```bash
jupyter notebook "CAP_5636_HW3.ipynb"
```
