The difference between the two lies in efficiency. With **Heuristic 1** (simple wrong-side count), the search **expanded 14 nodes** before reaching the goal, while **Heuristic 2** (minimum trips estimate) **needed only 12 nodes**. This shows that **Heuristic 2** provides a **better progress** by modeling the farmer’s required trips more realistically.\n",

Before adding successors, I check if they are already in CLOSED with a cheaper path (skip), or already in OPEN with a cheaper path (skip or update). This prevents re-expanding the same state through different paths. I reused the admissible “minimum trips” heuristic from Problem 8, and A* continues to evaluate nodes by\n",

        "The performance is close to the tree search on this small puzzle, but the graph version is more efficient overall because it avoids revisiting the same states.
